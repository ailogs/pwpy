Here's a list of modules that I wrote but removed because they haven't
been used for a while. Consult this file before writing a new module
from scratch!

cosmology.py -- evaluate standard FRW cosmological integrals
elcmp.py -- "Compare elevations of various sources over time"
mpfit.py -- semi-customized version of Python port of Markwardt's
            mpfit; deprecated in favor of pwmpfit.git
numstd.py -- import a subset of numpy functions, popaarray(), and rms()
tweaky.py -- plot a function with tunable parameters and see their effect
