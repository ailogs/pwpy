%B
	autoflag is a MIRIAD-compatible program that edits visibility data.
	calibration of visibility data. Either phase only or amplitude and
	phase calibration can be performed. The inputs are visibility data
	files and model images. This program then calculates the visibilities
	corresponding to the model, searches for redundant visibilities, and
	solves for the gains.
%A cal
	Name of input calibrator files. No default. Multiple data files
	can be entered in a comma-separated list. These should be strong
	point sources. At least one calibrator file is required.
%A vis
	Name of input visibility data files. No default. Multiple data files
	can be used in a comma-separated list. These data should be closely
	associated in time with the calibrator scans.
%A options
	This gives several processing options. Possible values are:
	  noflag      Do not write the flag table; useful to see what would be done
	  reten       Flag any baseline with less than 50% initial retention
	  time        Examine the time-series data for each scan
	  noband      Skip the internal bandpass calibration step
	  nophase     Skip test of phase variance on calibrator data
	  norfi       Skip the narrow-band and transient RFI flagging steps (not recommended)
	  dist        Skip the data distribution test
	  noise       Skip the baseline noise test
	  nosingle    Skip RFI flagging for single visibilities
	  ata         Check for spectral corruption (for ATA data only)
	  interpolate Copy flags from previous/next calibrator scans to source scans
