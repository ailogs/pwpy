This directory contains various of Peter Williams' reduction
scripts. I'll try my best to make it obvious what they do, but no
promises.

The scripts contained in this directory (mmm/pwilliams) should only
require a standard MIRIAD install to operate.

The scripts contained in the "fancy" subdirectory rely on my stack
of Python bindings to MIRIAD. There's a fairly complicated set of
software that needs to be set up for these to work. See 

   XXX write a logbook page

for information on how to get access to an environment that lets you
give those scripts a spin.

I actually keep the scripts in a Git repository in my home directory;
if you know what that means, I can set up direct access for you. If
you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.
