This directory contains various of my (Peter Williams) reduction
scripts. I'll try my best to make it obvious what they do, but no
promises.

The scripts contained in this directory (mmm/pwilliams) should only
require a standard MIRIAD install to operate.

The scripts contained in the "BBS" subdirectory are my scripts for
my broadband spectra observing campaign.

The files in the "pyata" subdirectory are for HCRO computers, 
allowing you to run various useful ata* commands in Python.

The scripts contained in the "fancy" subdirectory
(mmm/pwilliams/fancy) rely on my bridge between Python and Miriad. See

http://badgrads.berkeley.edu/doku.php?id=miriad_in_python

for information on how to give those scripts a spin.
