= Mirdl

Provides Ruby access to MIRIAD subroutine libraries using custom C extension
and the Ruby dl extension.  The mirdl gem differs from the miriad gem in that
Mirdl accesses MIRIAD routines written in both C and Fortran whereas the miriad
gem only supports the MIRIAD routines in the C based uvio library.  On the
other hand, the miriad gem does not require a local MIRIAD extension whereas
the mirdl gem does.  This distinction means that these two gems are not
redundant.
