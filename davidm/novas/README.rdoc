This file includes an RDoc hack so that links can be made to open up into a new
frame rather then the current frame.

The "trick" is to append ``"target="_top'' to the URL.

= NOVAS-Ruby

== Introduction

The NOVAS-Ruby package...

1. Makes NOVAS routines accessible from Ruby.

2. Makes Ruby usable with NOVAS routines by adding convenience,
   utility, and astronomy related methods to Ruby classes.

== Installation

NOVAS-Ruby can be installed in three easy steps.

1. Install Ruby.  See the {Ruby Download Page
   }[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/"target="_top] for instructions.

2. Install RubyGems (for Ruby < 1.9.0)  See the {RubyGems web site
   }[http://www.rubygems.org/"target="_top] for instructions.

3. Install NOVAS-Ruby by running...

   <tt>gem install novas</tt>

   or

   <tt>sudo gem install novas</tt>

== Documentation

You are reading part of it!

=== On the web

The latest documentation is published on the {NOVAS-Ruby Home
Page}[http://novas.rubyforge.org/"target="_top]

=== At your local site

The NOVAS-Ruby gem contains full documentation, which will be installed along
with the gem (unless you specified <tt>--no-rdoc</tt> or <tt>--no-ri</tt>, but
why would you do that?).

To view the local HTML documentation generated from the RDoc comments:

1. Run <tt>gem server</tt>.

2. Point your browser at <tt>http</tt><tt>://localhost:8808/</tt>

3. Find the +novas+ entry.

4. Click on the [rdoc] link.

To view the local +ri+ documentation (kind if like +man+ or +info+ for Ruby),
just run <tt>ri <em>class_or_method</em></tt>.  For example, to find out about
all the ways to call <tt>topo_star()</tt>, type <tt>ri
Novas::CatEntry#topo_star</tt>.

== Acknowledgements

The NOVAS-Ruby gem is distributed with a copy of the NOVAS-C 2.0.1 source
files.  Most of the functionality provided by NOVAS-Ruby is actually performed
by this C code; NOVAS-Ruby merely exposes the functionality to Ruby.

The NOVAS-C library was written by John A. Bangert, U. S. Naval Observatory,
based on Algorithms and FORTRAN code by George H. Kaplan, U. S. Naval
Observatory.  Their 

Much of the documentation for the {NOVAS}[link:classes/Novas.html] routines was
transcribed into Rdoc format from the {NOVAS-C software documentation
}[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas/novas_c/novas-c2-doc.pdf"target="_top].
